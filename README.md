# AI ML Misc Projects

This repo contains uploads of AI/ML projects (including some learning-based projects).

## Documentation:
 In each directory there is a **Jupyter** notebook (ipynb file), which includes **documentation and code**.
 Please select the file (Github allows viewing directly without downloading) to see a preview.

A brief summary of the projects is provided below:
- **Algebraic Function Minima**:  
Used PyTorch's Autograd feature for a calculus experiment.
- **CNN Image Binary Search**: 
Mixed two concepts - binary search and image CNN to reduce the size of a CNN network.
- **Kaggle Cancer Detection**: 
Downloaded data from an older Kaggle competition and trained a CNN model to learn how cancer detection can be done with a CNN network.
